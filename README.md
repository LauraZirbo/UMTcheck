I have assumed that this problem is case sensitive since the characters 'a' and 'A' have different ascii values.

THERE ARE 7 TYPES OF PROBLEMS THAT CAN ARRISE:
	1. THERE ARE REPEATTING CHARACTERS (aaa)
	2. THERE ARE NO LOWERCASE LETTERS
	3. THERE ARE NO UPPERCASE LETTERS
	4. THERE ARE NO DIGITS
	5. THERE ARE TOO FEW CHARACTERS
	6. THERE ARE TOO MANY CHARACTERS
WE HAVE TO SEE IF WE CAN MAKE A CHANGE SO THAT WE SOLVE MULTIPLE PROBLEMS AT ONCE WHICH WILL RESULT LESS CHANGES BEING MADE.
I HAVE ALSO PROVIDED AN EXAMPLE OF STRONG PASSWORD FOR TWO REASONS:
	1. TO SHOW IT TO THE USER AS AN EXAMPLE OF STRONG PASSWORD
	2. TO ALWAYS HAVE AN UPDATED VERSION OF THE PASSWORD TO CHECK FOR ANY NEEDED CHANGES
